🌐 Servlets & Web Integration
For a Java application, Servlets are the foundational technology for extending the capabilities of a server (like Apache Tomcat or Jetty) to host web applications. Integrating Servlets would transform your Core Java Weather Application into a Web-Based Application, accessible via a browser.

1. Servlets Overview and Role in the Application
A Servlet is a Java class that is used to handle client requests (like a user clicking a button in a browser) and generate dynamic content (the HTML page displaying the forecast).

Handling the Request: When a user types a city name and clicks "Search" in a web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server.

Servlet as Controller: A specific Servlet (e.g., WeatherServlet) receives this request. It acts as the Controller that manages the flow, replacing the GUI layer's role in the desktop application.

Processing: The Servlet calls your existing Business Logic Layer (e.g., the WeatherAPIClient and DataParser classes) to fetch and process the weather data.

Generating Response: The Servlet then packages the processed Java data (the Weather objects) into an HTTP response (typically HTML) and sends it back to the browser for display.

2. Key Servlet Mechanisms
Servlets utilize specific methods and interfaces to execute the request-response cycle:

HttpServlet Class: Your custom Servlet class (e.g., WeatherControllerServlet) would typically extend the HttpServlet abstract class.

doGet() and doPost(): These methods are overridden to handle different types of HTTP requests:

doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp): Used when a user types a URL directly or clicks a simple link. In your application, this could handle displaying the initial page or refreshing the current weather.

doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp): Used when submitting data via an HTML form. This is what would capture the user's City Name search input.

Request & Response Objects:

HttpServletRequest: Used to retrieve client information, most importantly input parameters (e.g., String city = req.getParameter("cityInput");).

HttpServletResponse: Used to set response headers and obtain an output stream (or a PrintWriter) to write the HTML response back to the client.

3. Web Integration Process (The Flow)
Integrating your application logic into a web environment requires several layers:

Client (Browser): User submits a form with a city name.

Web Container (Server): The server (e.g., Tomcat) receives the request and maps the request URL (defined in web.xml or via annotations) to your WeatherServlet.

Servlet Execution:

The doPost() method executes.

It extracts the city parameter (req.getParameter()).

It invokes the Business Logic (e.g., Weather weatherData = weatherService.getForecast(city);).

Forwarding/Dispatching: Instead of writing complex HTML directly in the Servlet, the Servlet often forwards the data to a presentation technology like JSP (JavaServer Pages).

Servlet: Gathers and processes the data.

JSP: Uses the data passed by the Servlet to generate the final HTML structure, separating data logic from presentation.

Response: The rendered HTML page is sent back to the browser.

This architecture follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, where the Servlet acts as the Controller, the Business Logic is the Model, and the JSP is the View.

4. Benefit: Decoupling and Scalability
Moving to a Servlet-based web application offers significant advantages over a desktop GUI:

Zero Client Installation: Users only need a web browser; there's no need to install Java or the application files locally.

Centralized Updates: All updates and maintenance happen centrally on the server.

Decoupling (MVC): Servlets enforce a clean separation between Data Logic and Presentation, making the application much easier to maintain, debug, and scale. If you want to change the visual layout
(CSS/HTML), you only modify the JSP/View layer, leaving the Servlet and API communication logic untouched.
